backHack

by: Kirk Hayes(l0gan)

This project is because I was tired of having to be rooted to hack my apps.  For this to work, you must have drivers for your phone installed.  This includes ADB and ABE to let everything work.  That may change....

To run:

command:  ./backHack.sh <package name>  (i.e.  ./backHack com.king.candycrushsaga)

Use at your own risk!!

Will be creating a python script to do the same thing, with menus and all at a later time.
